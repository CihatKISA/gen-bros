- **Authenticated User**: A user who has registered and logged into the system
- **Topic Generator**: The core AI tool that generates content topic suggestions
- **Dashboard**: The authenticated user's personal area for managing saved topics
- **Tool Module**: A discrete AI-powered feature within the system (e.g., Topic Generator)
- **Category**: A subject area or niche for which topics are generated
- **Topic Suggestion**: An AI-generated content idea for social media
- **Saved Topic**: A topic suggestion that an authenticated user has stored for future reference
- **Session**: An authenticated user's active connection to the system
- **API Key**: Sensitive credential stored in environment variables for external service access
